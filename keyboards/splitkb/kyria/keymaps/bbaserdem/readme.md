This folder contains my Kyria (`split_3x6_5`) board layout.
Check out the [user readme](../../../../../users/bbaserdem/readme.md) for more info.

# Kyria

I use a rev 1.3 PCB as a daily driver.

## Hardware

* Using a modified High-profile case; with metal switch plate.
* Currently using a Pro-Micro and an Elite-C as microcontrollers.
* Using Gateron Silent Black Ink with Progressive springs (100g), lubed.
* Have mill-max sockets for hotswap feature.
* All microcontrollers and OLED's are socketed for easy removal.

## Features

* Use two thumb keys in the 2u layout.
* Have rotary encoders in the outermost keys of the thumb cluster.
* Have underglow leds soldered.

## Issues

* Stabilizers squiek, and need lubing.
* The double tap buttons (home row; left leader the most) don't contact well.

## Todo

* Switch to Proton C conversion with a game plan.
* Lube stabilizers.
* Get tenting puck.
* (Not depending on me) migrate this code to layouts.
