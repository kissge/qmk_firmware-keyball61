# Gherkin

I use [Gherkin](../../../../keyboards/40percentclub/gherkin/readme.md).

It is used as a game pad, and key layout is inspired by spare keys I had lying around.
The firmware is very simple, and only includes one layer keymap, and RGB effects.

## Status

* [x] Layout adapted
* [x] Tested build
* [x] Confirmed on board

## Build

Build command: `CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated" <FILL-IN-LATER>`
