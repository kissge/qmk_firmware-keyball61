# keyball

Keyball is split keyboard has 100% track ball

## Firmware build guide

Keyball46 have separate firmwares for each of PCBs w/ trackball and w/o
trackball.  You can build those with this commands in root of QMK firmware
source tree.

```console
$ make keyball/rev1/ball:via
$ make keyball/rev1/noball:via
```

You will get two files:

* `keyball_rev1_ball_via.hex` - Trackball PCB firmware with VIA support.
* `keyball_rev1_noball_via.hex` - No trackball PCB firmware with VIA support.

Write each firmwares to correct PCB's Pro Micro.

In generally, you can build fimwares with this command.

```console
$ make keyball/rev1/ball:{YOUR_FAVORITE_KEYMAP}
$ make keyball/rev1/noball:{YOUR_FAVORITE_KEYMAP}
```

### Keyamaps

Keyball46 provides some keymaps as default:

* `via` - VIA support, trackball is on right side
* `via_Left` - VIA support, trackball is on left side
* `test` - Test for building/soldering Keyball46 (w/ right trackball)
* `default` - Template for customized keymap (w/ right trackball)

3. Copy `./qmk_firmware/keyboards/keyball/` directory in this repository to QMK firmware's dir as `{QMK_FIRMWARE_ROOT}/keyboards/keyball`.
4. Build Keyball46 firmwares (See above section)

    ```console
    $ make keyball/rev1/ball:via
    $ make keyball/rev1/noball:via
    ```
